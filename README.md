# Four bug problem simulation with Pyton

Before running the code, please install the following packages:
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. tkinter

Next, run:
1. four_bug.py if you want a simulation of the four bug problem where each bug starts at a vertex of a square, moves to the next bug in a clockwise direction (i.e., move to $(i+1)\%4$ bug) with the same initial speed.
2. four_bug_assymmetry.py if you want a simulation of the four bug problem where each bug starts at a vertex of a square except for bug four which is stationary at a position within the square, moves to the next bug in a clockwise direction (i.e., move to $(i+1)\%4$ bug).
